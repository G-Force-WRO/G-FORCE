# G-FORCE 
### A repository conveying the success of the preparation of the G-FORCE team for the WRO Future Engineers competition 

In this repository, you can find all the files from our documentation. Look at our branch and open files to see robot photos, team photos, 3D models, etc.

## File description 
##### On 'Our Photos', we have two photos of our team: Chill, and Official
##### The file 'Code' has the code for 'Round 1' and 'Round 2'
##### The file '3D models' has the CAD design for all parts of the robot and an assembled CAD of the entire robot
##### 'Schematic Diagrams' is a file that displays the wiring in the file 'Electric Diagram' and displays the mechanical system in the file 'Mechanical Diagram'
##### 'Robots Photos' is a file consisting of the pictures of the robot from all angles



## Journey 

#### 17th September: 
The team was trying to get the open round to work. The team has finished a draft robot, and the CaD is finished. Right now, it is not working. The bot is only moving forward and not turning; I suspect that ultrasonic sensor 2 is incorrect. I will resolder a new one tomorrow and edit the code more.

#### 18th September: 
The team encountered and debugged issues involving ultrasonic sensors u0 and u2. The CaD went through another iteration, redo-ing the ultrasonic sensor.

#### 20th September: 
We rewrote the whole code to debug it. Moreover, we made a new prototype of the robot from scratch. Furthermore, we improved the ultrasonic code and replaced a servo.
